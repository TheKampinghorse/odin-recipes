    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Melomakarona are one of the most popular treats in Greece during the Christmas holidays with their intense homely smell full of cloves, 
            cinnamon, and nutmeg.
        </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 pound unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 and 3/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>3 egg yolks</li>
                <li>1/2 cup freshly-squeezed orange juice/li>
                <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>1 cup honey for syrup</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, spices, baking soda and baking powder.</li>
                <li>Beat the butter until it is light in color and fluffy, about 10 minutes in a stand mixer. 
                    Add the sugar and continue mixing for about 5 more minutes.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and orange juice together. Add to the butter mixture 
                    and make sure it is thoroughly incorporated.</li>
                <li>Add dry ingredients in 3 parts, mixing after each addition, then add the teaspoon of honey. 
                    Mix just until a soft dough forms. Chill dough 30 minutes to 1 hour before shaping.</li>
                <li>Shape the dough into small ovals and flatten a little on the cookie sheet. These cookies do spread a little, 
                    so be sure to leave enough room in between. Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes, or until they are lightly golden brown.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat the syrup ingredients over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Let cool.</li>
                <li>When cookies are cool enough to handle, dip into syrup on both sides for about 10-15 seconds. 
                    Gently press freshly-dipped cookies top side down onto crushed walnuts, then place on wax paper top side up. 
                    Let dry completely before you store.</li>
            </ol>
